# CAN-Troubleshooter
This program lets the user know if a device can properly send and recieve CAN data frames.

It does this using a CAN bus module that allows the Arduino Uno to communicate with the device over the CAN High/Low pins of the OBD port.

This program is to be run in the Arduino IDE and uses the mcp_can library by coryjfowler and builtin SPI library from Arduino.
